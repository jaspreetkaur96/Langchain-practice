Your taxable income can include wages, salaries, tips, interest earned on investments, and profits from businesses.\\n\\nThe government uses a progressive tax system, which means that the more money you earn, the higher your tax rate will be.

The tax brackets range from 10% to 37%, with the higher tax rates applying to those with higher incomes.\\n\\nThere are also different types of taxes that may be taken out of your paycheck, such as Social Security and Medicare taxes.
